# Expence Sharing
Welcome to Expence Sharing, the shared expense tracker built with Ruby on Rails! 

Expence Sharing allows to user and his/her group of friends, roommates, coworkers, etc. keep track of who owes whom. 

Once you've signed up for an account, you can:
- create a new "group" for expenses (e.g. for your housemates)
- add expenses evenly split among group-members (by default), or with a custom division
- keep track of your outstanding debts and IOUs
- settle up with individual group-members and clean the slate for more expenses down the line
